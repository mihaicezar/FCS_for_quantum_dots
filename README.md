## FCS_for_quantum_dots
Full counting statistics for the study of blocking states in quantum dots

This code was used in the numerical calculations that supported the experimental data of the PhD thesis **_Lumped Impedance Matchers and GHz Noise Investigation of Quantum Dots_** (Basel, 2018).

Full counting statistics (FCS) are built on a master equation approach that involves the rates of all possible transitions between the states of the system. The master equation is extended into a *counting field* (technically, its Fourier transform) in order to make possible the calculation of the cumulants (moments), i.e. the *current* and the spectral density of the *current noise* power.
